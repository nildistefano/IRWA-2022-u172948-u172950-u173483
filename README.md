Part 1: The code can be directly executed, but make sure you have the input files on the right folder
Json files and csv have been uploaded to the git and will be accessed from the code through paths:
- data_folder = './data/'
- output_folder = './output/'
Besides that, nltk.stopwords and nltk.punkt download lines have been commented. If an error occurs, meaning that you don't have it installed on you device, uncomment it.
